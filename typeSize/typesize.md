# Understanding Data Types in Go

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Understanding Data Types in Go" repository! This simple Go program explores different data types such as integers, uints, floats, and complex numbers. The program aims to provide a basic understanding of how these data types work in Go.

## Key Concepts

- **Integers and Uints:** Integers represent positive whole numbers without decimals. Uints are unsigned integers.

  - Types: uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr

- **Floats:** Floats represent signed decimal numbers.

  - Types: float32, float64

- **Complex Numbers:** Complex numbers are used less frequently.
  - Types: complex64, complex128

## Explanation

The program includes a demonstration of converting a float to an int for illustrative purposes. Here's a summary of the conversion:

- Convert the float value `2.6` to an int using `int64(accountAgeFloat)`.
- Print the result indicating the account's existence in years.

## Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Go file (`main.go`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
4. Run the following command:

```go run typeSize.go```

## Output

Upon running the program, you will see information about the various data types in Go and a specific example highlighting the conversion of a float to an int.
